Week #1 Looking back on this week seems to be a blur of information. I'm somewhere between feeling like I have an overload of terms to remember and knowing that I've learning nothing near what I will in the coming weeks! I think I'm going to need to dust off my mental filing cabinet so it has more room for terminology and new ideas. I'm genuinely excited to move forward and see what the new few weeks have to offer.

I have found my own fear to be my biggest obstacle this week. To paraphrase the quote by Franklin D. Roosevelt, I sincerely feel, "I have nothing to fear but fear itself." I seemed to have a smoother time of things when I just embraced the lessons and made sure I didn't stand in my own way!
